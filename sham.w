@* Symmetric Hamiltonian Cycles.
A {\it Hamiltonian cycle\/} of a graph visits every vertex exactly once and
returns to its start. This program counts the Hamiltonian cycles of a graph that
are {\it symmetric\/}: the graph has the central automorphism that sends each
vertex $v$ (numbered $0$ to $N-1$) to its mate $N-1-v$, and we want only the
cycles that map to themselves under it.

The graph here is the one whose vertices are the squares of an $8\times9$ board
and whose edges are knight moves; it is built by |Board| from the Go port of
Knuth's {\it Stanford GraphBase\/} (SGB). The program is itself a port to Go,
and to \.{GWEB}, of Knuth's \.{SGB} demonstration program {\tt sham}; the commentary
here is newly written.

The search exploits the symmetry directly. Identify every vertex with its mate,
giving a {\it quotient\/} graph of half the size. A symmetric cycle of the
original graph projects onto a {\it path\/} in the quotient that runs between two
``boundary'' vertices, and conversely such a path lifts back to a symmetric
cycle. So instead of hunting for cycles in the big graph we hunt for Hamiltonian
paths in the half-size one, which is enormously cheaper. Each arc remembers, in
the low bit of its length field, whether it crossed between a vertex and its
mate's side; those bits decide whether a path lifts to a genuinely symmetric
cycle.

@* Folding the graph in half.
|Board| numbers the squares $0,1,\ldots,N-1$, and the central symmetry pairs
square $v$ with square $N-1-v$ (its |mate|). Because the vertices live in one
contiguous slice, ``mate of $v$'' is just the vertex at index $N-1-v$, and a
comparison of vertices is a comparison of their indices.

We walk the lower half of the squares and rewrite their arcs. An arc that stays
within a class --- its tip's mate has the {\it higher\/} index, so the tip is
already the class representative --- keeps its tip and is marked with length~$0$.
An arc whose tip belongs to the upper half is redirected to that tip's mate (the
lower-index representative) and marked with length~$1$, recording that it
crosses to the opposite side. Halving |g.N| then discards the upper half.

This step can create multiple arcs between two classes, and self-loops; we deal
with the self-loops next.
@<Build the knight graph and reduce it by symmetry@>=
g, err := gbbasic.Board(mm, nn, 0, 0, 5, 0, false) // piece 5 = knight moves
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
N := g.N
for i := int64(0); N-1-i > i; i++ {
	v := &g.Vertices[i]
	for a := range v.AllArcs() {
		tip := g.Index(a.Tip)
		u := N - 1 - tip // index of the tip's mate
		if u > tip {
			a.Len = 0
		} else {
			a.Len = 1
			a.Tip = &g.Vertices[u]
		}
	}
}
g.N /= 2

@* Getting ready to search.
Self-loops would confuse the forcing rule below (a vertex of apparent degree~1
that is really a dead end), and they are never part of a cycle, so we splice them
out of every arc list first.
@<Remove self-loops@>=
for i := range n {
	v := &g.Vertices[i]
	var prev *Arc
	for a := v.Arcs; a != nil; a = a.Next {
		if a.Tip == v {
			if prev != nil {
				prev.Next = a.Next
			} else {
				v.Arcs = a.Next
			}
		} else {
			prev = a
		}
	}
}

@ The search keeps three pieces of per-vertex bookkeeping, in slices indexed by
vertex number: |deg| is the current number of usable arcs (it shrinks as
vertices are taken and grows back on backtracking); |taken| marks the vertices
already on the path; and |ark| records, by path position, the arc chosen at each
step. After clearing the self-loops we count each vertex's degree and remember a
vertex |x| of smallest degree to start from --- a small fan-out near the start
keeps the search tree thin.
@<Prepare the graph for backtracking and find a minimum-degree vertex@>=
n := int(g.N)
deg := make([]int64, n)
taken := make([]bool, n)
ark := make([]*Arc, n)
id := func(v *Vertex) int { return int(g.Index(v)) }

@<Remove self-loops@>

dmin := n
var x *Vertex
for i := range n {
	v := &g.Vertices[i]
	taken[i] = false
	d := 0
	for range v.AllArcs() {
		d++
	}
	deg[i] = int64(d)
	if d < dmin {
		dmin = d
		x = v
	}
}

@ As a consistency check (handy when porting), we print the degree sequence; the
same line is printed again at the very end, where it must agree. A start vertex
of degree less than~2 cannot lie on any cycle, so there is nothing to do.
@<Check that the search can start@>=
@<Print the degree sequence@>
if deg[id(x)] < 2 {
	fmt.Printf("The minimum degree is %d (vertex %s)!\n", deg[id(x)], x.Name)
	return
}

@ @<Print the degree sequence@>=
for i := range n {
	fmt.Printf(" %d", deg[i])
}
fmt.Println()

@ Every Hamiltonian path we want leaves |x| by one edge and returns to |x| by
another, so we try each unordered pair of edges at |x|: the first edge starts
the path, and the tip of the second is the vertex |z| where the path must end.
@<Search from every pair of edges leaving |x|@>=
count, dcount := 0, 0
for b := x.Arcs; b.Next != nil; b = b.Next {
	for bb := b.Next; bb != nil; bb = bb.Next {
		findPaths(g, deg, taken, ark, x, bb.Tip, b, &count, &dcount)
	}
}

@*The backtrack search.
|findPaths| enumerates every simple path that begins with arc |a|, ends at |z|,
visits all $n-1$ vertices other than |x|, and never uses |x|. It is a classic
backtracker, written here --- as in the original --- with explicit labels and
|goto|s rather than nested loops, because the control flow (advance, try the
next edge, restore state, back up) maps onto labels very directly.

One pruning rule does most of the work: when we step to a vertex |v|, we lower
the recorded degree of each of |v|'s neighbours by one (they have lost |v| as a
future option). If that makes some still-unused neighbour's degree drop to~1,
the path is {\it forced\/} to go there next, since it will soon be the only way
in or out. If two neighbours become forced at once, this branch is hopeless and
we restore and back up. The length field doubles as a tiny stack of flags
(|+4| marks a forced move, |+2| an ordinary one) on top of the crossing bit.
@<Sub...@>=
func findPaths(g *Graph, deg []int64, taken []bool, ark []*Arc,
	x, z *Vertex, a *Arc, count, dcount *int) {
	@<Set up the search state@>
advance:
	@<Take vertex |v|; record forced moves, or |goto backtrack|@>

	@<Try arc |a| and its successors; advance on the first free vertex@>

	aa = nil
restore:
	@<Undo the degree changes made on entering this level@>
backtrack:
	@<Step back one level and try the next option, or finish@>
done:
}

@ |level| is the current path length; the path is complete when it reaches
|tmax|$\,=n-1$. We mark |x| as used, and give the opening arc the forced flag.
@<Set up the search state@>=
n := int(g.N)
tmax := n - 1
id := func(v *Vertex) int { return int(g.Index(v)) }
var v, u *Vertex
var aa, yy *Arc
var d int64
level := 0
taken[id(x)] = true
a.Len += 4 // the first move is forced

@ On arrival we store the chosen arc, step forward, and mark |v| taken. If |v|
is the required endpoint |z|, we have a full path exactly when it is the last
vertex and has no other exit; either way this level is finished. Otherwise we
lower each neighbour's degree, watching for a forced continuation |yy| (and
bailing out to |restore| if a second forced move appears). A forced move is
taken immediately; otherwise we fall through to try |v|'s arcs in order.
@<Take vertex |v|; record forced moves, or |goto backtrack|@>=
ark[level] = a
level++
v = a.Tip
taken[id(v)] = true
if v == z {
	if level == tmax && deg[id(v)] == 1 {
		@<Record a solution@>
	}
	goto backtrack
}
yy = nil
for aa = v.Arcs; aa != nil; aa = aa.Next {
	u = aa.Tip
	d = deg[id(u)] - 1
	if d == 1 && !taken[id(u)] {
		if yy != nil {
			goto restore
		}
		yy = aa
	}
	deg[id(u)] = d
}
if yy != nil {
	a = yy
	a.Len += 4
	goto advance
}
a = v.Arcs

@ The ordinary case: scan forward for the first arc leading to a vertex not yet
taken, flag it, and advance. If none remains, fall through (with |aa| set to
|nil|, so the restore below runs over the whole arc list).
@<Try arc |a| and its successors; advance on the first free vertex@>=
for a != nil {
	if !taken[id(a.Tip)] {
		a.Len += 2
		goto advance
	}
	a = a.Next
}

@ Restoring means giving back the degree we borrowed from the neighbours of the
vertex we are leaving, up to the point |aa| where the entry scan stopped.
@<Undo the degree changes made on entering this level@>=
for a = ark[level-1].Tip.Arcs; a != aa; a = a.Next {
	deg[id(a.Tip)]++
}

@ Backing up: drop a level, free that vertex, and strip the move flags from the
arc, keeping only its crossing bit. If the move was an ordinary one (no forced
flag) we simply try its successor. At the very bottom we are done. A forced move
needs care: a forced arc may be one of a pair of parallel arcs, and we must
resume from its {\it partner\/} in the previous vertex's list rather than
backtrack past it; if there is no such twin, the move was truly forced and we
restore.
@<Step back one level and try the next option, or finish@>=

a = ark[level]
taken[id(a.Tip)] = false

goto restore_all

@ A completed path lifts to a symmetric cycle only when an odd number of its arcs
cross to the mate side; the exclusive-or of the crossing bits tells us which. The
others (an even number of crossings) still form a valid path but do not give a
new symmetric cycle, so we count them separately as ``wannabees.''

@ |report| echoes one tour: the start vertex, then each successive vertex,
prefixed by \.{*} when the arc into it crosses to the mate side.
