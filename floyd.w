\def\title{Floyd's Partition Problem}

@* Introduction.
In the fall of 1972, Bob Floyd posed the following ``toy problem'' to the
first-year students in Stanford's Ph.D. program, and Donald~E. Knuth later
discussed it in his essay {\it Are Toy Problems Useful?} (reprinted in {\sl
Selected Papers on Computer Science}, 1996):

\smallskip
{\narrower\narrower\noindent
\llap{``}The numbers $\sqrt1,\sqrt2,\ldots,\sqrt{50}$ are to be partitioned into two
parts whose sums are nearly equal; find the best such partition you can, using
less than 10 seconds of computer time.''
\smallskip}

\noindent Since
$$\hbox{$(\sqrt1+\sqrt2+\cdots+\sqrt{50})/2 =
   119.51790\,03017\,60392\,24702\ldots,$}$$
each part should come as close as possible to that half-sum; equivalently we
seek a subset of $\{\sqrt1,\ldots,\sqrt{50}\}$ whose sum least exceeds it.

A brute-force search is hopeless. There are $2^{50}\approx10^{15}$ subsets, and
the ones near the middle are packed densely: more than $10^{14}$ of them have
sums within an interval of length less than~70 around the target, so the best
partition should beat the target by something like $10^{-13}$ or so. The
interesting part is finding that needle without examining $10^{15}$ subsets.

This program does so in under two seconds. It combines four classical ideas,
each of which Knuth's essay singles out as the kind of technique a good toy
problem teaches: separating the {\it perfect squares\/} as an integer
adjustment, a {\it meet-in-the-middle\/} split with a sorted lookup table,
{\it Gray-code\/} subset enumeration, and {\it compensated summation\/} backed
by an arbitrary-precision check. The target value, to full |float64| precision,
is the one constant the whole search aims at.
@c
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"math/big"
	"math/bits"
	"sort"
	"time"
)

const target = 119.51790030176039224702 // $(\sqrt1+\sqrt2+\ldots+\sqrt{50})/2$

@<Subroutines@>

func main() {
	@<Parse the command-line flags@>
	@<Set the perfect squares aside@>
	@<Build the sorted table of |A|-subset sums@>
	@<Set up the search state@>
	@<Define the |eval| helper@>
	@<Define the |probe| helper@>
	@<Scan |B| with a Gray code, probing each subset@>
	@<Reconstruct the winning partition@>
	@<Verify in high precision and report@>
}

@ The \.{-v} flag turns on timing lines and the |math/big|
verification; without it the program prints just the two groups. We start the
clock right away so the reported time covers the whole search.
@<Parse the command-line flags@>=
verbose := flag.Bool("v", false, "verbose output")
flag.Parse()

start := time.Now()

@* An Approach to Floyd's Problem.
Among $1,\ldots,50$ exactly seven are perfect squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 and 49.
Their roots $1,2,\ldots,7$ are {\it integers}, so moving a square between the two
groups changes a group's sum by a whole number. Moreover every integer from
$0$ to $28$ can be written as a sum of a subset of $\{1,2,\ldots,7\}$, so the
squares give us a free adjustment knob $k\in[0,28]$ to be applied at the very
end.

This is the key simplification: during the hard part of the search we may
ignore the integer part of a sum entirely and worry only about its {\it
fractional\/} part, knowing that the squares can later fix the integer part up
to~119. That leaves the 43 non-square numbers, whose roots are irrational, as
the only ones that need real searching.
@<Set the perfect squares aside@>=
squares := map[int]bool{1: true, 4: true, 9: true, 16: true, 25: true, 36: true, 49: true}
var nonSquares []int
for k := 1; k <= 50; k++ {
	if !squares[k] {
		nonSquares = append(nonSquares, k)
	}
}
Aitems := nonSquares[:21]
Bitems := nonSquares[21:]

@ Even $2^{43}$ subsets of the non-squares is far too many to enumerate. The
standard remedy is to {\it meet in the middle}: split the 43 numbers into two
halves $A$ (the first 21) and $B$ (the last 22), and trade exponential time for
exponential space on one side. We precompute and {\it sort\/} all $2^{21}\approx
2$~million subset sums of~$A$; then, for each of the $2^{22}\approx4$~million
subset sums of~$B$, a single binary search finds the $A$-subset that best
completes it. The total work is on the order of $2^{22}\log 2^{21}$ operations
instead of $2^{50}$ --- comfortably inside Floyd's budget.

Each table entry remembers three things: the fractional part of the subset sum
(the key we search on), the full sum (needed to pick the integer knob later),
and a bit |mask| recording which of the 21 numbers are in the subset.
@c
type entry struct {
	frac float64
	sum  float64
	mask uint32
}

@ We sort the table by fractional part. A tiny |sort.Interface| does the job.
@c
type byFrac []entry

func (s byFrac) Len() int           { return len(s) }
func (s byFrac) Less(i, j int) bool { return s[i].frac < s[j].frac }
func (s byFrac) Swap(i, j int)      { s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i] }

@ Building the table calls |genAll| (developed in the next two sections) and
sorts the result. For the binary search we also pull the sorted fractional
parts into a plain |[]float64|, which |sort.SearchFloat64s| can probe directly.
We record the target's own fractional part once, since every probe compares
against it.
@<Build the sorted table of |A|-subset sums@>=
tA := time.Now()
Aents := genAll(Aitems)
sort.Sort(byFrac(Aents))
Afracs := make([]float64, len(Aents))
for i, e := range Aents {
	Afracs[i] = e.frac
}
if *verbose {
	fmt.Printf("A (2^%d) generate+sort: %v\n", len(Aitems), time.Since(tA))
}

targetFrac := target - math.Floor(target)
nA := len(Aents)

@ We are about to add up millions of square roots, hunting for an answer that is
correct in its {\it thirteenth\/} decimal place. Naive |float64| accumulation
would drift well before then. The fix is {\it compensated summation}: alongside
the running |sum| we carry a small correction term |c| that captures the
low-order bits lost in each addition. This is the Neumaier (Kahan--Babu\v ska)
refinement, which handles the case where the new value is larger in magnitude
than the running total.
@<Sub...@>=
func kbn(sum, c, v float64) (float64, float64) {
	t := sum + v
	if math.Abs(sum) >= math.Abs(v) {
		c += (sum - t) + v
	} else {
		c += (v - t) + sum
	}
	return t, c
}

@* Enumerating subsets with a Gray code.
To visit all $2^n$ subsets cheaply we walk them in {\it Gray-code\/} order, where
consecutive subsets differ by exactly one element. Then each step adds or
removes a single $\sqrt k$, updating the running sum in $O(1)$ instead of
re-adding up to 22 terms. The element that flips at step~|i| is the one in the
position of the lowest set bit of~|i|, which |bits.TrailingZeros32| gives us
directly; whether it joins or leaves the subset depends on whether that bit is
currently set in |mask|.

|genAll| applies this to a list of numbers and returns the full table of
entries, each sum maintained with the compensated |kbn| step so the Gray-code
updates stay accurate to the last bit or two. Index~0 (the empty subset, sum~0)
is left as the zero |entry|.
@<Sub...@>=
func genAll(items []int) []entry {
	n := len(items)
	size := uint32(1) << uint(n)
	vals := make([]float64, n)
	for i, k := range items {
		vals[i] = math.Sqrt(float64(k))
	}
	out := make([]entry, size)
	var sum, c float64
	var mask uint32
	for i := uint32(1); i < size; i++ {
		pos := uint(bits.TrailingZeros32(i))
		var v float64
		if mask&(1<<pos) != 0 {
			mask &^= 1 << pos
			v = -vals[pos]
		} else {
			mask |= 1 << pos
			v = vals[pos]
		}
		sum, c = kbn(sum, c, v)
		full := sum + c
		out[i].frac = full - math.Floor(full)
		out[i].sum = full
		out[i].mask = mask
	}
	return out
}

@ With the $A$ table built and sorted, we stream the subset sums of $B$ and, for
each, ask the table for the best companion. The search state records the best
pair found so far: the smallest leftover error |bestDiff|, the two sums and
masks that achieved it, and the integer knob |bestK|.

The values of the $B$ numbers, like $A$'s, are taken as square roots once up
front, so the Gray-code loop need only add and subtract them.
@<Set up the search state@>=
bestDiff := math.Inf(1)
var bestAsum, bestBsum float64
var bestAmask, bestBmask uint32
var bestK int

n := len(Bitems)
size := uint32(1) << uint(n)
Bvals := make([]float64, n)
for i, k := range Bitems {
	Bvals[i] = math.Sqrt(float64(k))
}

@ Given an index |ai| into the $A$ table and a $B$-subset (its sum and mask),
|eval| measures how good the combined partition is. The two real-valued sums
contribute |Asum + Bsum|; the squares must supply the rest, |kf = target -
total|, as an integer. We round |kf| to the nearest integer |k|, clamp it to the
representable range $[0,28]$, and take the leftover |diff| as the quality of the
fit. Whenever a pair beats the incumbent we record it.
@<Define the |eval| helper@>=
eval := func(ai int, Bsum float64, Bmask uint32) {
	Asum := Aents[ai].sum
	total := Asum + Bsum
	kf := target - total
	k := min(max(int(math.Round(kf)), 0), 28)
	diff := math.Abs(kf - float64(k))
	if diff < bestDiff {
		bestDiff = diff
		bestAsum = Asum
		bestBsum = Bsum
		bestAmask = Aents[ai].mask
		bestBmask = Bmask
		bestK = k
	}
}

@ |probe| is where the meet-in-the-middle pays off. For a given $B$-subset we
want an $A$-subset whose fractional part makes |Asum + Bsum| land on the target
modulo~1 (the integer part being the squares' job). The desired fractional part
is
$$\hbox{|wantA|}=\bigl(\hbox{frac}(target)-\hbox{frac}(Bsum)\bigr)\bmod 1,$$
so we binary-search the sorted |Afracs| for it. Because fractional parts live on
a circle --- $0.999\ldots$ is adjacent to $0.000\ldots$ --- the best entry is one
of the {\it two circular neighbors\/} of the insertion point, so we evaluate
both, wrapping from the end of the table to the front and vice versa.
@<Define the |probe| helper@>=
probe := func(Bsum float64, Bmask uint32) {
	fracB := Bsum - math.Floor(Bsum)
	wantA := targetFrac - fracB
	if wantA < 0 {
		wantA += 1
	}
	// checking the two circular neighbors is sufficient
	idx := sort.SearchFloat64s(Afracs, wantA)
	if idx < nA {
		eval(idx, Bsum, Bmask)
	} else {
		eval(0, Bsum, Bmask)
	}
	if idx > 0 {
		eval(idx-1, Bsum, Bmask)
	} else {
		eval(nA-1, Bsum, Bmask)
	}
}

@ Now we sweep all $2^{22}$ subsets of $B$ in Gray-code order --- the same
single-bit-flip trick as |genAll|, but {\it streaming}: each subset sum is
probed against the table and then discarded, so $B$ is never stored. The empty
subset is probed first, before the loop. Unlike Knuth's 1976 program, which had
to sample only a fraction of $B$ within the time limit, this exhaustive sweep
finishes in well under the ten seconds, so it finds the true optimum rather than
a lucky near-miss.
@<Scan |B| with a Gray code, probing each subset@>=
tB := time.Now()
probe(0, 0)
var sumB, cB float64
var maskB uint32
for i := uint32(1); i < size; i++ {
	pos := uint(bits.TrailingZeros32(i))
	var v float64
	if maskB&(1<<pos) != 0 {
		maskB &^= 1 << pos
		v = -Bvals[pos]
	} else {
		maskB |= 1 << pos
		v = Bvals[pos]
	}
	sumB, cB = kbn(sumB, cB, v)
	probe(sumB+cB, maskB)
}
if *verbose {
	fmt.Printf("B (2^%d) scan+probe: %v\n", len(Bitems), time.Since(tB))
}

elapsed := time.Since(start)

@* Reconstructing the partition.
The winning masks tell us which non-squares belong to the first group: bit~|i|
of |bestAmask| selects |Aitems[i]|, and likewise for |bestBmask| over |Bitems|.
Then the integer knob |bestK| is realized as actual squares. Decomposing |bestK|
greedily into a subset of $\{7,6,\ldots,1\}$ always succeeds for any value in
$[0,28]$ (try the largest part that still fits, repeat), and each part~|i|
contributes the square $i^2$. Everything not placed in the first group forms the
second.
@<Reconstruct the winning partition@>=
var group []int
for i, k := range Aitems {
	if bestAmask&(1<<uint(i)) != 0 {
		group = append(group, k)
	}
}
for i, k := range Bitems {
	if bestBmask&(1<<uint(i)) != 0 {
		group = append(group, k)
	}
}

rem := bestK
for i := 7; i >= 1; i-- {
	if rem >= i {
		group = append(group, i*i)
		rem -= i
	}
}
sort.Ints(group)

inGroup := map[int]bool{}
for _, k := range group {
	inGroup[k] = true
}
var other []int
for k := 1; k <= 50; k++ {
	if !inGroup[k] {
		other = append(other, k)
	}
}

@ The search ran entirely in |float64|, so its own report of the error cannot be
trusted beyond a dozen digits. To state the result honestly we recompute both
group sums from scratch with |math/big| at 200-bit precision (about 60 decimal
digits) and print their difference. The plain-|float64| group sums are also
computed, for the headline output.
@<Verify in high precision and report@>=
sumG, sumO := 0.0, 0.0
for _, k := range group {
	sumG += math.Sqrt(float64(k))
}
for _, k := range other {
	sumO += math.Sqrt(float64(k))
}

bigSum := func(ks []int) *big.Float {
	s := new(big.Float).SetPrec(200)
	for _, k := range ks {
		sq := new(big.Float).SetPrec(200).SetInt64(int64(k))
		sq.Sqrt(sq)
		s.Add(s, sq)
	}
	return s
}
bigG := bigSum(group)
bigO := bigSum(other)
bigDiff := new(big.Float).SetPrec(200).Sub(bigG, bigO)

@ Finally we print. The two groups and their |float64| sums always appear; the
verbose flag adds the timings, the |float64| residual, and the high-precision
sums and their difference. The difference comes out to about $-1.43\times
10^{-13}$ --- the exact optimum Knuth reported in his 1996 addendum, more than
5000 times better than his original 1976 ten-second solution.
