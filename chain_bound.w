@* Introduction. Knuth's Stanford GraphBase page carries a list of Challenge
Problems---``several yet-unsolved problems on which I'm hoping readers will
make significant progress''---and calls this one of the most fun of them:
{\sl What is the biggest score Stanford can rack up over Harvard by a simple
chain of results from that year?\/} The year is 1990, and the graph produced
by {\sc GB\_\,GAMES} records its 638 college football games; if team~$u$ beat
team~$v$ by $d$~points we may chain the two together and claim that $u$ is
$d$~points better than~$v$, provided that no team appears twice in the chain.

The page keeps score. Knuth's own best was 2279, the chain that {\sc FOOTBALL}
describes; Buel Chandler improved it to 2448 by applying genetic programming
ideas to Knuth's algorithms; and on 25 November 2001 Mark Cooke reported a
chain worth 2473, together with a matching upper bound found in February 2002.
So 2473 is optimal. The page records two more values: 2358 for Harvard over
Stanford, and 2542 for Penn State over Columbia, which is the maximum over all
pairs of teams.

This program proves all three of those numbers from scratch, and exhibits the
optimal chains, in a fraction of a second. It is a companion to a longer
program of mine that attacks the same challenge with iterated local search;
that one climbs to within five points of the optimum but can never say that
it has arrived. Here I do nothing but bound, and the bound turns out to be
so sharp that the search hardly needs to search at all. That, rather than the
numbers themselves, is what I found worth reporting.

@ The idea is an old one from the travelling salesman literature, applied to
a longest-path problem. Drop the requirement that the chain be connected and
keep only the degree constraints, and what is left is an assignment problem,
which the Hungarian algorithm solves exactly in $O(n^3)$ steps. Every chain
satisfies the degree constraints, so the assignment value is an upper bound.
If the assignment happens to be a single path, that path is a chain achieving
the bound and we are done; otherwise it contains a cycle, which no chain may
contain, and we branch on which edge of that cycle to leave out.

Usage is
$$\hbox{\tt chain\_bound [-from=Team] [-to=Team] [-c] [-t=limit]
 [-D=directory]}$$
where \.{-from} and \.{-to} default to \.{Stanford} and \.{Harvard} and must
be spelled as in \.{games.dat}; \.{-c} prints the winning chain game by game,
in the format of the {\sc FOOTBALL} demo; and \.{-t} is a time limit after
which the program reports the best bounds it has reached instead of a proof
(the default, 0, means no limit).

@ Here is the whole program. It reads the season, solves the root relaxation,
dissects it for the reader, and then runs the branch-and-bound search.

@* The problem. A chain is a simple path in the graph of {\sc GB\_\,GAMES}:
a sequence of distinct teams in which consecutive teams played each other. If
|v| follows |u| in the chain we earn $|del|[u][v]$, the number of points by
which |u| beat |v| in their game (a negative number if |u| actually lost).
So the problem is to find the simple path from |start| to |goal| that
maximizes $\sum|del|$. This is a longest-path problem, and longest path is
NP-hard; but there are only 120 teams here, and as we shall see the
instance is far from the worst case.

	vScore [][]int64 // points scored by the second team
	date   [][]int64 // day of the game
	start  int
	goal   int
}

@ Two teams occasionally met twice, once during the season and once in a bowl
game. When we are maximizing we may always use the better of the two results,
so |del| keeps the larger point spread and remembers that game's scores and
date along with it.

	}
	return t
}

@* The assignment relaxation. Look at a chain and count degrees. The first
team has one outgoing edge and no incoming one; the last team has one incoming
edge and none outgoing; every other team either passes the chain along---one
edge in, one edge out---or takes no part at all.

Now keep those degree constraints and throw away the requirement that the
whole thing hang together in one piece. What survives is exactly an assignment
problem: choose for each team a successor, and for each team a predecessor,
consistently. Its solutions are the sets consisting of one path from |start|
to |goal| together with any number of vertex-disjoint cycles among the
remaining teams. Every chain is such a solution, so the optimum of the
relaxation is an upper bound on the optimum chain.

The bound comes with a certificate attached. If the optimal assignment has no
cycle of positive value, then its path alone already achieves the whole
relaxation value---cycles of value zero contribute nothing---and upper bound
meets lower bound. If some cycle $e_1,\ldots,e_m$ has positive value, no chain
can contain all of it, so at least one $e_k$ must be left out. We therefore
split the problem into $m$ subproblems: in the $k$th, edge~$e_k$ is forbidden
and $e_1,\ldots,e_{k-1}$ are forced. Splitting on the index of the first
omitted edge makes the subproblems disjoint, which is the classical
subtour-elimination branching rule.

@ A node of the search tree records its forbidden and forced edges, the
successor mapping of the relaxed solution under those restrictions, and the
resulting bound. The |bounder| carries the problem, the base cost matrix, and
the incumbent---the best chain found so far, which is our lower bound.

@<Type declarations@>=
type bbNode struct {
	bound  int64
	banned [][2]int
	forced [][2]int
	succ   []int
}

type bounder struct {
	p       *problem
	rows    []int // row number to team (every team but |goal|)
	cols    []int // column number to team (every team but |start|)
	rowOf   []int
	colOf   []int
	base    [][]int64
	inc     int64 // the incumbent's value
	incPath []int
}

@ A forbidden entry gets a cost so large that any assignment using one is
recognizable by its total. Costs are at most a few hundred and the matrix has
120 rows, so $2^{40}$ leaves room to spare.
@<Type declarations@>=
const forbid = int64(1) << 40

@ Rows are indexed by the teams that must choose a successor, that is, all
teams but |goal|; columns by the teams that must choose a predecessor, all
teams but |start|. The diagonal entry for a middle team is the ``take no
part'' option and costs nothing. Note that |start| has no column and |goal|
has no row, so neither of them has a diagonal entry available: the first team
is forced to choose a real successor and the last a real predecessor, which is
just what we want. Since the Hungarian algorithm minimizes, we negate.

@* The Hungarian algorithm. Here is the $O(n^3)$ form that maintains dual
potentials |u| and |v| and grows one augmenting path per row. ({\sc
ASSIGN\_\,LISA} contains a Hungarian method too, but that one is a standalone
program tuned for rectangular matrices, so a short square-matrix version of
my own is more convenient here.) On return, |match[j]| is the row assigned to
column~|j|, numbered from~1; the results reported are the column chosen by
each row and the total cost.

@<Subroutines@>=
func hungarian(a [][]int64) ([]int, int64) {
	n := len(a)
	const inf = int64(math.MaxInt64 / 8)

	}

@ Column~0 is a fictitious column that holds the row we are currently trying
to place. We walk to the unused column of least reduced cost until we reach a
column that nobody occupies, then walk back along |way| reassigning as we go.

@* Solving one node. To evaluate a node we copy the base matrix, impose its
restrictions, and call |hungarian|. Forbidding an edge is a single entry;
forcing one means forbidding every other entry in its row and in its column.
If the answer still uses a forbidden entry---which shows up as a total of
|forbid| or more---the node is infeasible and we drop it.

@ To decide whether a node is finished we look for a cycle of positive value
in its relaxed solution. Following successors from |start| marks the path;
a team that points at itself is sitting the game out; whatever is left forms
the cycles. Among the positive ones we return the shortest, since the number
of children is the length of the cycle we branch on.

@* Best-first search. Nodes wait in a heap ordered by decreasing bound, so the
top of the heap is always a valid upper bound for the whole problem. That has
a pleasant consequence: if we run out of time we can still report honestly how
far the gap has been narrowed, instead of having nothing to show.

@* Anatomy of the root relaxation. It is worth asking why the bound is as good
as it is, and the answer is visible if we take the relaxed solution apart.
Every assignment solution splits into one path, some disjoint cycles, and the
teams that chose their diagonal entry; so let us weigh the pieces separately.

@<Type declarations@>=
type piece struct {

	tot  int64 // how many points it earns
	head int   // a team to name it by
}

@ For Stanford to Harvard the dissection comes out like this:
$$\vbox{\halign{\hfil#\quad&\hfil#\quad&\hfil#\cr

There, in one table, is everything the relaxation is allowed to get away with.
A chain would have to thread all 120 teams onto a single string; the relaxation
instead runs a short path of 43 games and lets the other teams form little
rings of their own, harvesting good games with no obligation to connect them
to anything. And yet all that freedom is worth only $2498-2473=25$ points,
about one percent. That is why the search finishes in 351 nodes:
the relaxation is standing almost on top of the answer. Had the gap been wide,
the tree would have exploded and heuristics would still be all we had.

@ @<Dissect the root relaxation@>=
plen, ptot, cycles, skipped := bd.decompose(root.succ)
var ctot int64
for _, c := range cycles {
	ctot += c.tot

	plen, ptot, len(cycles), ctot, skipped)
for _, c := range cycles {
	fmt.Printf("    cycle of %d teams, %+d  [%s ...]\n",
		c.len, c.tot, p.names[c.head])
}

@* Results. Running the program on the three instances mentioned in the

all three agreeing with the values Cooke reported. The last two take a few
hundredths of a second and the first about three seconds, nearly all of it
spent in the 351 Hungarian calls.

The third instance is the prettiest: its optimal assignment has no positive
cycle at all. The very first Hungarian call returns a path through 117 games
worth 2542 and no cycles, which is to say it hands us the chain and the proof
in the same breath.

I find the last column the interesting one. The challenge has stood since 1993
and was answered by an eight-year campaign of increasingly clever heuristics;
but the instance itself, approached from above, is nearly trivial. My own
local-search program spent a hundred and fifty seconds to get within five
points of the optimum and could not certify even that. So the moral is not
that heuristics were the wrong tool, but that it is worth measuring the
relaxation gap before assuming that NP-hardness describes your instance.

Here, finally, is what the first instance looks like when the program is asked
to show its work, with all but the ends of the chain elided:

The last line is the dip promised earlier: Columbia lost to Harvard, so the
running total falls from 2476 to 2473 on the very step that completes the
optimal chain.

ub, lb, chain, nodes, proven := solveExactly(p, *limit)

@ A proof is worth no more than the checking of it, so before printing we
verify mechanically that the answer is a simple path, that each of its edges
is a game that was really played, and that its value is what we said.

for k, v := range chain {
	if seen[v] {

	}
}
if p.total(chain) != lb {
	log.Fatalf("value mismatch: %d != %d", p.total(chain), lb)
}

@ The chain is printed exactly as {\sc FOOTBALL} prints one: the date, then
each team with its nickname and score, then the running total in parentheses.
Because we are maximizing a sum and not a minimum, a game that |u| lost may
well belong to the best chain, so the running total sometimes dips.
